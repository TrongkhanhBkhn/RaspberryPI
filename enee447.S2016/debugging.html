<strong><font size=+1>Thoughts on Debugging C Programs</font></strong>
</p>

Here are some hints for those of you new to the C programming language.
These are not elegant solutions to your problems, these are quick & dirty
ways to find out what is going on.
Real programmers use symbolic debuggers; they use programs like
<i>gdb</i>, <i>dbx</i>, and <i>adb</i> to run their applications.
If you get the chance, learn to use <i>gdb</i>; it is a powerful debugger
for UNIX systems, but it is not nearly as nice as the windows-based
graphical debuggers you have used in the Macintosh and Windows environments.
You will find that debuggers are amazing tools, but when you get into real-world
programming, you often are trying to debug systems with many different programs that are
talking to each other over a network or through shared memory, and you cannot
use a normal debugger at all.
So, you will often fall back on these ridiculously rudimentary techniques.

<p>

Therefore, I am not going to talk about debuggers here; I will talk about simple,
quick, easy, incredibly inelegant solutions to many of your problems.


<p>
<strong><font size=+1>Printf</font></strong>
</p>

First off, you cannot trust <i>printf</i>.
Generally speaking, by the time the stuff gets printed out on the screen, the 
program is actually well ahead of the <i>printf</i>.
This means that say you have the following code:
<pre>
	while (something) {
	    printf("top of loop \n");
	    func1();
	    printf("after func1\n");
	    func2();
	    printf("after func2\n");
	}
</pre>
The program output always ends after "top of loop" and then prints
out "Segmentation violation" and dies.
This leads you believe that the problem is in <i>func1</i>, but for
the life of you, you cannot find anything wrong in <i>func1</i>.
The problem is that <i>printf</i> takes its time to print things to the screen,
so that it only runs when there is a lot of stuff to print -- it queues up
work to do and then prints out a whole bunch of lines at once.
Therefore, the problem could very well be in <i>func2</i>, but you were misled
by trusting <i>printf</i>.
Here is how to fix it so that you <b>can</b> trust <i>printf</i>:
<pre>
	main()
	{
	    /* variable declarations */

	    setbuf(stdout, NULL);

	    /* first instruction of the program */
	}
</pre>
Insert the <i>setbuf</i> function call at the beginning of <i>main</i>,
immediately after your variable declarations.
This tells the print library to turn off buffering for <i>stdout</i>, which is
the output stream that <i>printf</i> goes to.
You can do this for any FILE * if you want: <i>stdout</i>, <i>stderr</i>, or any file that you <i>fopen</i>.
<p>
So now, you CAN trust <i>printf</i>; the last thing printed WILL be the last thing successfully executed.


<p>
<strong><font size=+1>__LINE__</font></strong>
</p>

There are several nice features of the C preprocessor.
One of the more useful ones that I have used is the __LINE__ variable
(that is two underscore characters on either side of LINE; total of four underscores).
This is not a C variable, it is a preprocessor variable.
The C preprocessor will go through and replace this variable with the line
number on which it occurs before compiling the file.
Therefore, suppose you have something like the following
at the top of your file:
<pre>
	#define HI	printf("line %d\n",__LINE__);
</pre>
You can go through your code and pepper it with "HI" statements
so that you know exactly when something happened.
Note that this means you have to have turned off buffering on <i>stdout</i>,
as described above, or you have to explicitly flush the output, as follows:
<pre>
	#define HI	{ printf("line %d\n",__LINE__); fflush(stdout); }
</pre>
The <i>fflush</i> function call tells the printing library to immediately
print the contents of the buffer.
Once you have this set up, you can place these little "HI" statements throughout
the problem-areas of your code and learn exactly where things went wrong:
<pre>
	main(int argc, char *argv[])
	{
	    /* variable declarations removed */

	    if (argc != 3) {
		printf("error: usage: %s <assembly-code-file> <machine-code-file> \n",
		    argv[0]);
		exit(1);
	    }

	    HI

	    inFileString = argv[1];
	    outFileString = argv[2];

	    HI

	    inFilePtr = fopen(inFileString, "r");

	    HI

	    if (inFilePtr == NULL) {
		printf("error in opening %s\n", inFileString);
		exit(1);
	    }

	    HI

	    outFilePtr = fopen(outFileString, "w");

	    HI

	    if (outFilePtr == NULL) {
		printf("error in opening %s\n", outFileString);
		exit(1);
	    }

	    HI
</pre>
When you run the program, you will see a stream of "line XXX" statements.
The last one that prints is the last thing that executed correctly, so
this should help you home in on the thing that caused the SEGFAULT.

<p>
<strong><font size=+1>Pointers</font></strong>
</p>

Pointers represent possibly the single largest source of errors in writing C programs.
Some of the problems arise because people are a bit unsure about when to use the
* operator, other problems arise because people forget that the pointers are
uninitialized, or have unexpected values (NULL pointers usually cause the most grief),
and then even more problems arise because the pointers reference locations that
are no longer valid (for instance, locations on the stack).
I will address each of these in turn.

<p>

<b>What is the point of the * operator and when should it be used?</b>

<p>

The * operator is used in both pointer declarations and in normal expressions.
There is a fairly simple way to determine what a pointer is and how to use it;
when you declare a pointer, it looks something like the following:
<pre>
	int *ip;
</pre>
You can always tell what something is from the way it was declared:
<pre>
	int *                     ip;           (ip is an int *)
	int                      *ip;           (*ip is an int)
</pre>
The original declaration says that <i>ip</i> is a pointer to an integer.
From then on, when you use the expression
<pre>
	ip
</pre>
it is evaluated to mean a pointer.
The variable <i>ip</i> contains a number that is interpreted to be
the address of a storage location holding an integer value.
If you want to see the <i>contents</i> of that storage location, you use the * operator.
From the original declaration, if we look at both the * and the <i>ip</i> together,
we see that the combination is an int:
<pre>
	int *ip;
	int                      *ip;           (*ip is an int)
</pre>
Therefore the expression
<pre>
	*ip
</pre>
evaluates to the <i>contents</i> of the storage location that <i>ip</i> points to,
i.e. an integer.

<p>

Note that this even extends to pointer-pointers:
<pre>
	char **cpp;

	char **                  cpp            (cpp is a pointer to a char-pointer)
	char *                  *cpp            (*cpp is a char-pointer)
	char                   **cpp            (**cpp is a character)
</pre>
The expression
<pre>
	cpp
</pre>
evaluates to a pointer referencing another pointer.
The expression
<pre>
	*cpp
</pre>
evaluates to the pointer that <i>cpp</i> references.
And the expression
<pre>
	**cpp
</pre>
evaluates to the character that <i>*cpp</i> references (or the first character
in the string, if appropriate).

<p>

<b>When is a pointer initialized <i>properly</i>?</b>

<p>

A pointer is initialized properly when it contains the location of what
you expected it to.
For instance, if you expect the pointer to reference some structure or
a string somewhere in memory, then it should contain some large number,
and it should definitely NOT contain the value zero.
For instance, the following is an error:
<pre>
	char *cp;
	printf("%s\n", cp);
</pre>
We are using the pointer <i>cp</i> before we have initialized it to anything.
Similarly, the following is an error:
<pre>
	char *cp;
	strcpy(cp, "some string");
</pre>
This is an error because <i>cp</i> does not yet refer to a valid storage location.
When we attempt to copy bytes into the storage location that <i>cp</i> points to,
we send the bytes into limbo.
Most likely, <i>cp</i> points to memory address 0 or a random location.
Memory address 0 is actually good (<i>cp</i> == NULL) because the program
will die as soon as we attempt to copy anything into location 0.
If the pointer initially points out into the wild blue yonder (as it
probably does if the pointer is an <i>automatic variable</i>--see the
<a href="ex-3.html">Crash Course on C</a>), then it might accidentally
point to a memory location that we <i>do</i> have permission to overwrite, 
in which case we're trampling on <i>good</i> data.
This problem is <i>extremely</i> hard to detect; generally, the program simply
dies, but it dies much later than spot at which you overwrite good data.
In some systems, the problems could show up minutes, hours, or even <i>years</i> later.
Or perhaps the program never dies, and the only weirdness is that every third
Tuesday, people living in towns that begin with the letter <i>V</i> are charged
$100 per minute for their long-distance phone calls.
<p>
So when you are programming your RiSC assembler, there are points at which 
you initialize the pointers <i>label</i>, <i>opcode</i>, <i>arg1</i>, <i>arg2</i>, etc.
(or whatever you chose to call them).
Every time through the loop, these pointers are re-initialized to have new values.
Therefore, every time through the loop--every time you read a new line from the
assembly-code file--these point to new places.
And some may have been set to the value NULL to indicate that such an item
was not present on the assembly-code line (for instance, the line did not have
an initial <i>label</i>).
You do NOT want to try to print these values out before testing them.
The best solution:
<pre>
	if (label != NULL) {
	    printf("label = %s\n", label);
	} else {
	    printf("label = NULL\n");
	}
	if (opcode != NULL) {
	    printf("opcode = %s\n", opcode);
	} else {
	    printf("opcode = NULL\n");
	}
	if (arg1 != NULL) {
	    printf("arg1 = %s\n", arg1);
	} else {
	    printf("arg1 = NULL\n");
	}
	...
</pre>
In general--do not attempt to <i>use</i> a pointer (i.e. print it out, copy from it, copy into it)
until you know for sure that it is valid.

<p>

<b>All of a sudden, the data I'm pointing to changed, and I <i>know</i> I didn't do it.</b>

<p>

I have mentioned before that there is a huge difference between statically-defined data
objects and automatic variables.
In the following example, every variable that begins with an upper-case letter
happens to be statically-defined, every variable beginning with a lower-case letter
is an automatic variable.
Note that the code below contains at least one flaw.
<pre>
	#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

	short ProgramCounter;
	char  Labels[100][16];
	short Addresses[100];
	int   NumValidLabels;

	short
	get_label_address(s)
	char *s;
	{
	    int i;

	    for (i=0; i&lt;NumValidLabels; i++) {
		if (strlen(Labels[i]) == 0) {
		    printf("problem: empty label in the Labels array.\n");
		    printf("  either NumValidLabels is wrong, or we \n");
		    printf("  messed up somewhere.\n");
		    return -1;
		}
		if (strcmp(Labels[i], s) == 0) {
		    return Addresses[i];
		}
	    }
	    return -1;
	}

	char *
	read_a_line_of_input(fp)
	FILE *fp;
	{
	    char line[128];
	    static int LineCount=0;

	    if (fgets(line, 128, fp) == NULL) {
		return NULL;
	    } else {
		LineCount++;
		return line;
	    }
	}

	FILE *OutFilePtr;

	main(int argc, char *argv[])
	{
	    FILE *infileptr;
	    char *cp;

	    if (argc != 3) { 
		printf("error: usage: %s &lt;assembly-code file&gt; &lt;machine-code file&gt;\n", argv[0]); 
		exit(1);
	    }

	    infileptr = fopen(argv[1], "r");
	    if (infileptr == NULL) {
		printf("error: can't open file %s", argv[1]);
		perror("fopen");
		exit(1);
	    }

	    OutFilePtr = fopen(argv[2], "w");
	    if (OutFilePtr == NULL) {
		printf("error: can't open file %s", argv[2]);
		perror("fopen");
		exit(1);
	    }

	    while ((cp = read_a_line_of_input(fileptr)) != NULL) {
		/* do stuff */
	    }
	}
</pre>
The four variables at the top of the program are all global variables, visible to all functions.
The <i>OutFilePtr</i> variable just above the <i>main</i> function is also global,
but it is only visible to the <i>main</i> function (and any functions that may be below <i>main</i>).
Each of the lower-case variables in the various functions are automatic variables and
are destroyed as soon as the function exits.
Note that the <i>main</i> function is not destroyed until the program terminates, so for
all intents and purposes, the automatic variables in <i>main</i> are static because they
will never go away -- <b>however</b>, they are only visible inside the <i>main</i> function.
Similarly, the <i>LineCount</i> variable in the <i>read_a_line_of_input</i> function is
declared as static, and is allocated on the heap; it will never get destroyed until the
program terminates, and the variable is only visible to the function <i>read_a_line_of_input</i>.

<p>

Here is the flaw.
The <i>read_a_line_of_input</i> function has an automatic-storage variable called <i>line</i>
that it reads data into (via <i>fgets</i>).
Then it returns the address of the data buffer.
Since the buffer is allocated on the stack, it will be wiped out.
Therefore, you cannot trust data returned from this function.
When you point to it, the data might look good at first, but <b>very soon</b> the data
will change out from under your feet.
(technically speaking, there is a window of opportunity in which the data will be valid,
and I can go into that later if anyone is interested)

<p>

How do you fix this flaw?  Oe solution: make the <i>line</i> variable static by moving it
outside of the function in which it is used.  
Fom that point on, it is a global variable, and it will not go away when the stack is purged.
It will also be visible to any other function in the program, but hopefully the program is written
so that other functions keep their hands off.

<p>

By the way, the <i>get_label_address</i> function works correctly and is not flawed.
You will need something similar to this in your assembler.

<p>

Hope this helps,<br>
